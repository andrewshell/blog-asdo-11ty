## Health Challenges

After facing ongoing challenges with my health and energy levels, particularly over the summer, I’ve decided to take a more proactive approach. I’m starting a program called [Virta](https://www.virtahealth.com/), recommended by my doctor, which is designed to help manage weight and blood sugar. From what I understand, it follows a ketogenic (keto) approach but with the added benefit of medical supervision throughout the process. I’ll be meeting with my advisor next week to learn more, and I’m hopeful that this program will provide the support I need to make positive changes.

A couple of years ago, for Christmas, I bought my mom a subscription to StoryWorth. It's a service that sent her a question to answer about herself every week for a year.
