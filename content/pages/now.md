## Virta Keto Diet

I started a medically supervised [Keto](https://www.webmd.com/diet/keto-diet-for-beginners) program called [Virta](https://www.virtahealth.com/) on October 28th.

I waited until Piper returned to school and our schedule settled down. I recently hit an all-time high of 307 lbs and had just been notified that my latest blood test showed I had crossed over into prediabetes. It was time to put in the effort and make some significant changes.

So far, I've been having a lot of success. After one week, I've lost 14 lbs, and my fasting blood glucose is normal.

## Rebooting Legacy Site

After having fun at Gamehole Con, I felt motivated to reach out to my friend Matt, who had acquired the Pen & Paper website over a decade ago.

When he acquired it, it was going to be taken down because it was broken, being hacked regularly, and the guy maintaining it was overwhelmed. At the time, we tried fixing it up, but we needed more time and energy for such an overwhelming project. We ended up replacing it with a WordPress site and copied over a few pages that people were asking for.

However, I've always regretted not doing something more.

Fast forward a decade, and I realized there are still many links around the internet that link to broken pages.

I'm now undergoing a project to bring the site back up from the dead, with a strategy to gradually bring content back online so we can review and update it, prioritizing pages that actually have links to from the internet at large.
