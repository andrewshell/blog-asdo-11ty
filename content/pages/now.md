## PetPlace

After 5.5 years at Johnson Health Tech, I started a new job at [PetPlace](https://www.petplace.com/) on May 19th. It's very intellectually demanding, and I feel more engaged than I have in a long time.

My primary project right now is building out [24PetShelter](https://www.24pet.com/products/24petshelter), a management tool for pet shelters.

The biggest shift is I'm going from an almost purely backend position to a frontend heavy full-stack role. I'm practicing my React skills daily and learning React Router 7 (formerly Remix), which I really enjoy.
