Hoopla! That word seems to have become a part of my brand. It started as me just being goofy one day at school after watching [Shock Treatment](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G6BLGK/), but now has become my stock greeting when I see people I know. It's gotten to the point where the hoopla precedes me. Once I met a boss's wife for the first time and after I said, "Hi, nice to meet you," she was like, "and.... don't I get a hoopla?"

I live in Madison, WI with my daughter Piper. I love being a dad. I wish I could stay at home and homeschool Piper, but it's not realistic for our family.

I'm a web developer. I wish I could say I'm a person who happens to do computer programming for a living, but who am I kidding? Programming is a part of who I am, and even if I had a billion dollars and didn't have to work another day in my life, I'd still be programming.

In 2011 I Co-Founded [Pinpoint Software](https://pinpointsoftware.com/) and build the flagship product Date Check Pro. I left the company in 2018 to pursue other interests but [Pinpoint was aquired by ADC](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211005005211/en/ADC-Acquires-Pinpoint-Software-Continues-to-Expand-Total-Store-Operations-Platform) (now [Upshop](https://upshop.com/)) in 2021.

I'm big on community. I founded [Madison PHP](https://www.meetup.com/madisonphp/) (a group for web nerds like me). I'm also involved in other groups and events in town, which all relate to the internet.

Currently, I work more with Node.js than PHP and manage a few interesting community projects.

I've [hosted](https://rpc.rsscloud.io/) and developed the JavaScript port of the [RSS Cloud Server](https://github.com/rsscloud/rsscloud-server) since 2015 which is used by feed aggregators to get notifications when a feed is updated.

I've also participated in the Federated Wiki community and built [Federated Wiki Feeds](https://feeds.fedwikiriver.com/) which crawls and aggregates fedwikis and provides a collection of different feeds and [rivers](https://fedwikiriver.com/).

I'm not currently looking for work but feel free to check out my [Résumé](/resume/).
