In August, I paused my [Keto](https://www.webmd.com/diet/keto-diet-for-beginners) diet. I was traveling a lot with my daughter for summer vacation, and you might be surprised to find it's hard to eat Keto at [Circus World](https://circusworld.wisconsinhistory.org/). I had plateaued and been out of ketosis for over three months (since the new job), so I'm guessing it's related to cortisol. 

My plan was to restart once she started school again in September, but I haven't. It's disheartening because I've regained about 40 lbs from where I was in August. I started the diet back in October 2024, the Monday before Halloween. Maybe that's a good time to restart and recommit to my diet.
