It’s 5:30 a.m. My house is still. My mind isn’t.

Every morning before my daughter wakes up, I pull a tarot card and ask ChatGPT to give me an inspired journal prompt. I spend time mining my subconscious, bringing thoughts and feelings that had been buried to the surface.

But what if the most important parts of your life never make it into your journal?

A few weeks ago, ChatGPT analyzed a week of my journals and [uncovered seven big open loops](https://blog.andrewshell.org/essays/emotionally-drained/) I wrestled with daily. Topics like expressing vulnerability, my professional identity, and, of course, [my fixed mindset](https://blog.andrewshell.org/essays/fixed-mindset/).

So, this week I asked ChatGPT to identify what areas I wasn’t writing about.

Areas like parenting, quality of life, and my life vision were absent from my journal. It turns out, I’d been missing the parts that matter most.

## Quiet Wheels Need Oil Too

Growth doesn’t just come from solving urgent problems.

One question that ChatGPT asked me was, “What role does my environment (home, workspace, routines) play in my energy and creativity?”

Two years ago, when I moved into my home, I had a panic attack.

I left a clean, well-organized apartment and moved into a “fixer-upper.” It didn’t occur to me that even though I’ve made a ton of progress, the chaos surrounding my house still weighs on me. A lot.

Now, I’m thinking about what I could do to make my home a calmer, more relaxing place. This is especially important since I’ll be working fully remotely once again next week. What can I do in my office to optimize it so that I can do my best work?

## What Are You Not Looking At?

Take a moment and ask yourself, “What parts of my life haven’t had a voice lately?”

What’s been steady, quiet, or easy to overlook?

Make space for what isn’t urgent. That quiet part of your life might be the key to real momentum.
