I sat down with Ryan Healy and [Ryan Paugh](http://ryanpaugh.com/), co-founders of [Brazen Careerist](https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/24/brazen-careerist-a-professional-network-that-realizes-youre-more-than-just-a-resume/). We talked about how they created [Employee Evolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20121014065558/http://www.employeeevolution.com/), met [Penelope Trunk](https://penelopetrunk.com/) and started Brazen Careerist.
