“Hey Dad, do you want to hear some popular music?”

I looked up from my phone. My daughter was sitting next to me on the couch, already queuing up her favorite songs. Then she jumped up and started showing me the dances she’d learned from YouTube.

It was spontaneous and surprisingly sweet.

And it never would’ve happened if I’d been in my office like I usually am.

I wasn’t doing anything special. I was just nearby. And that made all the difference.

## The Power of Just Being There

That little moment stuck with me.

Because I was there, the connection had space to happen.

We often think parenting is about planning activities or teaching lessons.

But some of the best moments can’t be scheduled. They show up when you’re within reach.

It turns out that presence doesn’t always mean engagement. Sometimes it’s just physically being there.

When I’m in my office, I miss those chances. When I’m on the couch, even doing my own thing, I give those moments a chance to find me.

That’s what I’m trying to do more of. Be around. Be close. Be available.


## Make Room for Connection

This isn’t about planning more activities.

It’s about being around more.

Not hovering. Not performing. Just staying within reach.

Sit on the couch. Work in the same room.

Some of the best moments happen when you’re nearby.

You don’t need to be entertaining.

You just need to be there.

That’s enough to change everything.
